# Introduction
This is the repository for an R file that demonstrates the concept of Literate Programming.

Literate programming combines data analysis with documentation. It can contribute to reproducible research by enabling reproducibilty.

Conceivably, the Literate programming could be combined with a Docker image for complete portability of results.

# Requirements
1. A working installation of R with up-to-date packages. This can be obtained from e.g. http://r-project.org.
2. Patience and a sense of humor.

# Releases
You can find the most recent _stable_ version of this code in the [releases](../../releases) part of this repository.

# How To Use This Code
I've split these off into the ["HowTo.md"](HowTo.md) file.

# Documentation
Documentation is provided in several forms:
* within `main.rmd`. Start here!
* within `main.pdf`, which will also contain the results when run using `knitr`.
* within `main.html`, which will also contain the results when run using `knitr`.

# Reporting Bugs and Requesting Improvements
